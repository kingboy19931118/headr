# Headr

[Headr](https://headr.io) is a cloud native, kubernetes powered, Golang 1.9 driven microservice architecture practice. Initially, it is meant to be a blogging website that combines the advantages of both traditional dynamic and static blogging tools and websites (such as [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)/[hexo](https://hexo.io/) for static and [CSDN](https://www.csdn.net/)/[jianshu](https://www.jianshu.com/)/[cnblogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/) for dynamic). but in the future maybe there's going to be more features depending on feedbacks.

I talked and will be talking more about Headr on my personal [blog](https://seagullbird.xyz/) (which is going to be transfered to Headr eventually :)) under tag `HEADR`, don't hesitate to visit or send me emails to discuss.
